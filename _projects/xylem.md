The  Lightweight Machine 2 Machine (LwM2M) device management protocol (presentation and service layer) and the 5G 700MHz narrowband communications standard (data link and physical layer), in conjunction with TCP-IP, will provide macro-area wireless coverage and connect resource-constrained IIoT devices to cloud-services. The application domains for these specific technologies are wide-area infrastructures such as pipelines, water networks and the electric-grid. The goal of this project is the evaluation and testing of the LwM2M protocol stack, by specifically characterizing its flexibility in controlling sensor resources and retrieving data, and also by analyzing its reliability, life-time, efficiency and security.
