description: "The power grid is one of the foremost examples of a large-scale man-made network. The nodes of the associated graph are the grid buses and its edges are its transmission lines. It is therefore natural to see measurements from the power grid as graph signals and model power grid measurements using tools from the theory of graph signal processing (GSP) whose goal is to extend fundamental insights that come from the frequency analysis for time series to the domain of signals indexed by graphs. In our research, we use GSP to provide new insights on how to analyze sensor data for the grid."
