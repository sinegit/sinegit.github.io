description: "The  Lightweight Machine 2 Machine (LwM2M) device management protocol (presentation and service layer) and the 5G 700MHz narrowband communications standard (data link and physical layer), in conjunction with TCP-IP, will provide macro-area wireless coverage and connect resource-constrained IIoT devices to cloud-services. The application domains for these specific technologies are wide-area infrastructures such as pipelines, water networks and the electric-grid."
